# analyzer tool for messenger messages

```sh

How to use:

Fist of all, you need to get your message information from Facebook (Instagram implementation in progress).
Here is how you can do this from browser version or from the android app:
1. Sign in to Facebook and click on your profile pic (or the three horizontal lines on android) on the top right
2. Settings & privacy
3. Settings
4. Download your information
5. Request download
6. Select types of information
7. Choose "Messages" only, then click next
8. Change date range to "All time", format to "JSON" and media quality to "low"
9. Submit request
   
Once the request is submitted, it might take up to a couple of hours until your files are compiled. When it's ready, you'll be able to acces it where you pressed "Request download" at step 5. Download it to Your computer, and unzip all of the folders into the same "messages" folder (this is how the folder will be named automatically).
Move this Jupyter notebook file next to the messages folder, there you can run it.
